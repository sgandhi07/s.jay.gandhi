### Alexander Hamilton to Radical Hamilton

Alexander Hamilton wore many hats, and among them is the founder of AMERICAN school of economics. In lieu of this fact, Hamilton's magnum opus, Report on the Subject of Manufactures, is criminally under-examined, according to Christian Parenti. To address this shortcoming, Parenti  successfully and dutifully examines the report in Radical Hamilton (Verso, 2020); and leaves us with a few ideas to let ferment, for contemporary use.

Parenti's work shows us how Alexander Hamilton, the statesman's actions were supported by Alexander Hamilton, the thinker and theorist. Hamilton wrote treatises on his economic and state-building ideas, and the scaffolding for his ideas is the MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL-BANKING locus. Hamiltom consolidated a group of rag-tag states into a nation of states, called the United States of America by: forming a National Bank and using its currency to nurture a domestic industrial economy, which would then bolster the military. The military was critically needed, during his time, to stave off attacks from across the pond and Indigineous populations, from whom they stole and ravaged the land. This network of banking, military, and economy(industry) was to be actively configured and maintained by the State. Today's laissez-faire, neoliberal, free trade, free market principles are absolutely not what the AMERICAN founder of economics prescribed, especially not in a time of crises.

Parenti notes that it is (almost) always in a time of crisis and upheavals that certain ideas germinate into blueprints, which then turn to practices, institutions, and norms, and that is why I find this book tangentially germane.

### CATASTROPHIES AND ELECTION YEAR

In the United States we are witnessing unprecedented wildfires raging across the American west coast; extreme increase in quantity of hurricanes in the American south; wildlife in "catastrophic decline" as exemplified by the mass death of migratory birds in American southwest; a global pandemic showing signs of second-wave resurgence; and our inability to act in response to livelihood decimation.

This year we also have an election coming up-- VOTE FOR BIDEN.

Biden, we VOTE and CALL on you to adopt the Green New Deal as part of the party platform. The Green New Deal or according to Pelosi, "Green dream of whatever" is a dream. It is the People's revision of the American Dream, and we ASK you that you let us dream, instead of leaving us to live this apocalyptic nightmare.

There is absolutely no reason that the Democrats are dragging their feed when it comes to adopting the Green New Deal platform, AND IF THEY LOSE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE ELECTION-- yes, voter suppression, state-sanctioned right-wing, fascist violence, and contested ballots will be a factor, BUT FAILURE TO EMBRACE THE GREEN NEW DEAL will be an Ace Of Spades the Democrats refused to play when all and everything was at stakes.

We are in a catastrophic crisis and the Democratic Party refuses to acknowledge and respond to the depth and extent of it.

### RADICAL HAMILTON TO BIDEN: "ADOPT THE GREEN NEW DEAL. IT'S THE (INDUSTRIAL) ECONOMY, STUPID!"

This crisis can be an opportunity though. A once in a lifetime opportunity at this point.
The Green New Deal offers an opportunity to re-shape and re-calibrate the military, industry, and state banking nexus, to serve current needs, using its founder's, Hamilton's, own economic logic and principles. After reading Parenti, I realized that the military-industrial complex is not new. It is baked into our country's foundation, but because it is baked in, we can leverage the logic for our own ends.

One of the greatest threats we now face is catastrophic climate change and wildlife destruction. We do not need the military to aim at any living being, necessarily. It needs to look out and prepare for a climate that we are completely unprepared to work with. (Cybersecurity is another threat, but I want to look at it in another post, when I finish the book Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff).

Today, we have an over-bloated, wasteful military, a fast disappearing industrial sector, and our banks/financial institutions are leeching the wealth up to the very top. Re-imagining our industrial sector, by way of GREEN NEW DEAL, is a low-hanging fruit we need to capture NOW. Taxes, subsidies, tariffs are all tools in the State arsenal that it needs to use and guide the Nation's industry towards green technologies and renewable energy. A robust manufacturing/industrial sector is essential for our survival, not only according to Hamilton, but according to a prescient Op-Ed in Next City by Tom Outerbridge and Tinia Pina "The Industrial Sector is at the Heart of Green New Deal."

Why the hoop-la over industry and manufacturing? Because we need to be able to build and manufacture green technologies. We cannot rely on exports, because Hamilton outlines, it leaves us susceptible to foreign vagaries, to our detriment. Moreover, we need industry to implement findings from R&D (research and development), and we NEED R&D to start and prepare for worsening effects of climate disaster. Though definitely not a fan of his, Google's ex-leader, Eric Schmidt, recently declared that the US "dropped the ball" on innovation. He cites decrease in State funding, and he is 100% not wrong; but he does fail to recognize the link between R&D and industry. If production is offshore, it's hard to fund research which has to jump hurdles to be implemented in a foreign country. We need equipment and technology on hand that can be nimble and re-purposed. According to Outerbirdge and Pinia, it is one of the reasons that China now leads in solar energy production, even though the US developed the solar panel concept. And this continues with the lead that China is taking with 5G, AI, and other emerging, innovative technologies. We NEED industry and WE NEED R&D to strategically ready ourselves for catastrophic climate disaster and wildlife destruction, and the GREEN NEW DEAL is a giant stride in that new, hopeful direction.

Biden, my guy, you have the historical backing to go for it. Our first treasurer, wrote heaps upon heaps, BEGGING his colleagues to give the State power to implement the policies, we are now BEGGING you to make use of. But you need to find the courage within yourself to face reality and take action with the powers that we, the people, will definitely bestow upon you, IF YOU ADOPT THE MOTHERLUVIN' GREEN NEW DEAL. Don't be like Hillary and refuse to meet us even close to half-way, because A LOT of Americans have been left with nothing to lose, so your winning or losing is meh.

It is high time for YOUR party to embrace a platform that will pull the people out of the static inertia of hopelessness and reinvigorate them a re-designed, inclusive, New American Dream AKA Green New Deal.
